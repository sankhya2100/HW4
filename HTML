This is I m trying to use git for my own sake, hope i get to learn it asap

This page will walk through the getting started with Git and Eclipse EGit integration tutorial using GitHub. Now days most of the software developer/student writes code on the Eclipse IDE and make their coding experience easy. We have a lots of valuable project and code that we programed and experiments on the system. But sometime we face the problem with our system (like system damaged, virus attack, HHD failure, etc.). In this situation we lost the project as well as code. But we have an alternate method to back up our project/code manually. Manual back up process is too lengthy and time consuming process.
